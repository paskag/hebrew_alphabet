# This is the game that I've done to learn Hebrew alphabet.

### I decided to create this game just for fun. I thought that it will be convenient to learn Hebrew alphabet via game.

There are 2 games to play:

1. Learning the names of the Hebrew letters
2. Learning the pronunciation of the Hebrew letters

### Names of Hebrew letters
